<p> "Hello Mister!
A voice came from behind me and I immediately turned around.

On turning around I saw a young boy of 15 years standing looking fearlessly with his face brushed and you can see some scars on his face..

Just looking at him I knew he was involved in a fight and so I didn't say anything to him.

I was repairing a car and so I focused on my work instead...

The young boy moved to the other side and stood right at my front..

Mister, I wanna learn how to fight.
He voiced voiced out immediately looking at me.

I wanna learn how to dodge, move as quickly as you did the other day and kick the enemies heavily...
He kept talking and demonstrating with his hands while I was busy with my work as though I wasn't even hearing what he was talking about...

Just few days ago I saved him From some gangsters who almost broke all his bones, but he never learned anything from that, and here he is asking me to teach him how to fight.....

He kept talking by himself until he got tired and then realized that I wasn't even paying attention to him...

Hello Mister! Can you please hear please hear me out?
He voiced out at the top of his voice..

I stopped and looked at him for some moment..

" Can you please get me a screwdriver over there?
I voiced out pointing my fingers..

He went and brought me the screwdriver and then started talking again...

" Like I was saying, I want to learn how to dodge quickly and move......

He was still talking when I voiced out..

" Can you please hand me that spanner?.

He looked at me and then went and brought the spanner...

" Thank you.
I voiced out innocently

He remained silent for some moment before he started talking again...

I was busy repairing the car that was before and not even paying attention to what he was saying...

Few minutes later I turned to him again..

" Excuse me, get me that Hammer please.
I pointed out innocently.

This time around he looked totally upset, " I'm talking about something else and you are asking me to bring this, bring that, won't you listen to me?.

He was talking angrily while looking at me, I was just staring at him as well without saying anything.

Finally he moved and brought the Hammer, " thank you, I voice out trying to get the hammer from him, but he was still holding it strongly..

" Can you please teach me?
He voiced out innocently.

I looked at him..
" I'm sorry, as you can see, the only thing I can teach you is how to repair vehicles, I don't teach how to fight and I'm not a fighter.
I voiced out innocently and then took the hammer off his hands....

" Come on man, I knew you used to be a gangster, I saw you fighting the other day.

" Just tell me how much you want, I'm gonna pay you that, I just wanna learn how to defend myself..
He kept talking...

I didn't say anything and when he got tired he walked away by himself...

Immediately he left, I stopped what I was doing and walked out of the garage just to look at him as he was going on his way..

The boy reminded me of myself when I was just 15 years old like him.
At that age I was a member of a gang even though I was still in high school, I moved around with big guys playing big boy and spending money any how.

Who knew I would end up working in a garage when my colleagues are driving cars and living in big houses happily married with children....

The one thing about life is that when other's are regretting, others are walking that same road unknowingly...

I just looked at him and went back to finish my work....

I owned a small garage around the neighborhood and of course that was the source of my income, behind my garage there is a small space and that is my house, so I stayed in the garage all the time unless I got a call to repair something somewhere...

The next day early in the morning I woke up and washed my face then opened the gate to my garage..

Surprisedly, this young boy was standing at the gate with his uniform and waiting for me to open the garage..

Good morning Mister, he voiced out immediately I opened the garage.

I looked at him and didn't say anything, I walked back into the garage to arrange something things..

The young boy walked after me and when I stopped he also stopped.

I turned and looked at him, ' young man, what do you want here when your colleagues are in school?.
I asked innocently looking at him.

" I told you I want to learn how to fight like you, I want to learn how to defend myself against the opponents..
He replied and continue....

I'm really gonna pay back, just teach me how to defend myself...

I looked at him without knowing what to say, I just walked away and continue with my work...

He stood there and won't leave and I didn't say anything to him, because I know that whatever I say won't make him leave unless I agree with him...

Few minutes later he brought out a pack of cigarette from his pocket, took one and placed it in his mouth, he then reached out for a lighter...

Just as he was about to light the cigarette, I walked to him and pulled off the cigarette from his mouth..

" I'm sorry, but you can't spoke here.
I voiced out innocently.

" Huh! Sorry, you should have place a sign that says no smoking...
He voiced out laughing..

Just hearing him, I could tell that he was lacking much from home training and definitely he needed help otherwise he will end up like me...

That same day he stayed with me in the garage without leaving until school closed before he walked away.

Just like the time, I walked after him while he was leaving just to look at him once again..

He kept looking at him until he was out of sight, I walked back into my garage and continue with my work....

The following day he came back again, this Time around he came  after school was closed..

While he was standing, I walked to him and placed a written note next to him, that says " NO SPOKING HERE PLEASE".

When he saw that he couldn't help it but to laugh out slowly...

Through out that week he never stop coming to my garage and whenever he came,  he will asked me to teach him how to fight....

So one evening when it was getting dark and he wasn't leaving..

I finished all my work and was about to close the garage, yet he was still standing...

I came feeling this feeling in me that came disturbing me and couldn't just sent him away..

So I invited him to come with me and he gladly followed me while smiling...

We walked to the back of the garage where I was staying, the place was a bit beautiful and he kept looking around..

" Waw! You got a nice place over here..he voiced out looking around.

I brought him a cup of coffee and as he was drinking I asked him...

" What is your doing for a living?.

" I don't have one.
He replied immediately.

" What do you mean by that?
I asked innocently.

" Well, I don't have a father.

" Huh! 
That was all o could voiced out.
I was thinking his father was dead, but he said he simply doesn't have one which means he didn't know his father..

" What about your mom?
I asked innocently.

" She is married abroad and staying with her husband..

Wonderful!ðŸ¤¦

" Huh!
And you are staying with?
I asked once again.

" With Grandma and Grandpa.
He replied...

On hearing that I understood why he was behaving the way he was...

I remained silent for some moment..

" So, are you gonna teach me how to fight?
He asked...

Friend, why do you wanna learn how to fight?
I asked innocently looking at him.

He started saying one thing after another demonstrating with his hands as though he was in a movie...

After he was done talking, I looked at him sadly...

And do you think there is any gain in fighting?.

Just look at me, you said it yourself that I used to be a gangster...

But as you can see,  I'm now a mechanic because all these fighting I used to do didn't take me anywhere....

TO BE CONTINUED......
